**FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is an international robotics competition designed for children aged 9 to 16 years old. It combines the excitement of LEGO building with the challenge of solving real-world problems using science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts. FLL aims to inspire young minds, foster teamwork, and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.**

**Each year, FLL releases a new theme that forms the basis for the competition. Teams of up to ten members, guided by adult coaches, participate in the challenge. The theme encompasses a real-world problem that teams must research and develop innovative solutions for. Examples of past themes include space exploration, natural disasters, energy, and transportation.**

**FLL offers young participants an engaging and hands-on experience in STEM fields. It helps develop technical skills like programming and robotics while fostering creativity, critical thinking, and teamwork. The program aims to inspire a lifelong passion for learning and problem-solving, preparing young minds to become future innovators and leaders in science and technology.**
