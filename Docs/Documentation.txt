classMotor(port, positive_direction=Direction.CLOCKWISE, gears=None, reset_angle=True)
LEGO Powered Up motor with rotation sensors.

Parameters :
------------
* port (Port) – Port to which the motor is connected.
* positive_direction (Direction) – Which direction the motor should turn when you give a positive speed value or angle.
* gears (list) –

    List of gears linked to the motor :
    ------------------------------------

    For example: [12, 36] represents a gear train with a 12-tooth and a 36-tooth gear. Use a list of lists for multiple gear trains, such as [[12, 36], [20, 16, 40]].
    When you specify a gear train, all motor commands and settings are automatically adjusted to account for the resulting gear ratio. The motor direction remains unchanged by this.


*    reset_angle (bool) – Choose True to reset the rotation sensor value to the absolute marker angle (between -180 and 179). Choose False to keep the current value, so your program knows where it left off last time.
